# ðŸ“¡ Embedded Telemedicine using Cognitive Radio Networks with OFDM PHY

A secure, real-time embedded telemedicine framework leveraging Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) PHY to provide remote healthcare access in bandwidth-constrained environments.


## Project Overview

In underserved and remote regions, access to real-time healthcare is limited by unreliable communication infrastructure and fixed-spectrum wireless systems. This project addresses these issues by:

- Integrating biomedical sensors with ESP32-C6 modules (Wi-Fi 6 enabled)
- Enabling intelligent, dynamic spectrum access through CRNs
- Using OFDM PHY for low-latency and robust data transmission
- Supporting real-time patient monitoring and robotic assistance via Raspberry Pi GUI

## Key Features

- Real-time acquisition of ECG, SpOâ‚‚, and Temperature data
- Adaptive wireless link selection using RSSI and SNR
- Live video streaming via ESP32-CAM
- Doctor-side GUI with real-time waveform plots and robotic arm control
- MQTT-based communication over Wi-Fi 6 with OFDM PHY
- 22% power efficiency gain and 31% latency reduction vs. fixed-spectrum systems

## Hardware Used

- **ESP32-C6** â€“ Cognitive radio node with Wi-Fi 6 support
- **Raspberry Pi 4B** â€“ Data aggregation, processing, GUI, and robotic control
- **AD8232** â€“ ECG sensor module
- **MAX30102** â€“ Pulse Oximeter (SpOâ‚‚ & Heart Rate)
- **DHT22** â€“ Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- **ESP32-CAM** â€“ For live video feed
- **Servo Motors** â€“ Robotic Arm actuation
